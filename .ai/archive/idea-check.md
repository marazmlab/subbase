# App - Subbase (MVP)

## 🔻 Main Problem

These days, most technology—and many everyday—services run on subscriptions. Over time, it’s easy to lose track of how many accounts we have, how much we’re actually spending, whether we’re paying for duplicate tools, or even whether we’re still subscribed at all.

SubTrack brings all your subscriptions into one place so you can track them effortlessly and see your spending clearly. With built-in AI insights, SubTrack helps you spot overlaps, identify waste, and prioritize the services that truly deliver value—so you can optimize costs without losing what matters.

## 🔻 Smallest set of features

- Create, save, view, edit, and delete subscriptions, displayed as easy-to-scan cards in your subscription library
- View a structured subscription list with key details for fast, hassle-free management
- Showinh monthly all subscriptions costs
- Secure user accounts that link each user to their own private subscription database
- AI-powered insights that detect overlapping services and recommend ways to optimize your subscriptions

## 🔻 Whats NOT included in an MVP?

- Manage subscriptions individually
- Share your subscription library with other users for collaborative access and visibility
- Enable social features for discovery, recommendations, and shared subscription planning

## 🔻 Success Criteria

- The user can register and log in and can only see their own data (no access to other users’ subscriptions).Jesteś doświadczonym menedżerem produktu
- The user can add at least 5 subscriptions.
- Full CRUD works end-to-end: create/edit/delete a subscription, and the change is visible in the UI.
- The dashboard correctly displays the total monthly and yearly cost for at least two billing cycles: monthly and yearly.
- AI generates at least 1 recommendations (overlaps/duplicates + optimization) for a test set of 5+ subscriptions.

I'm a developer analyzing a project idea that I'll be working on as part of the 10xDevs course. I'm interested in analysis based on the following criteria:

1. Does the application solve a real problem?
2. Can the application focus on 1-2 key features?
3. Am I able to implement this idea within 6 weeks working on it after hours with AI?
4. Potential difficulties

Before proceeding with the idea analysis, ask me about my experience, preferred tech stack, and other relevant matters that will impact the project implementation.
